# AlgorithmsImplementation
Implementation of algorithms of various problems

Algorithms so far implemented are :

1. Optimizing matrix chain multiplication

The algorithms added/ to be added will/ do cover a variety of areas, such as graph theory, computational geometry etc.
Major inspiration for dynamic algorithms solutions taken from CLRS book
